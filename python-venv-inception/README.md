Let's see what we can do tp preserve the environment, going from one venv to another.

Init creates a few venvs and installs the dependencies of apps with corresponding number.

Wrappers apply different strategies to preserve venv, and displays a diff of the environment before and after.

run-app-in-venv does just that. Choose venv to activate first, then run app through selected wrapper.
