= Dead things = 
Be prepared to do some digging!

== greybeard-hugo ==
Sketches out auto deploy using caddy, hugo, and github deploy keys. Along with webhook listener checking for passphrase.

Why? Didn't want to be there for each deployment of web pages.

It did work, but other content makers didn't take off, so lesser need for making a less involved deployment.

== multipass-helper ==
Why? Lazy using Canonicals multipass. Used it a bit, which was nice enough, but fell out of use.

Perhaps best used for command reference.

== python-venv-inception ==
Trying to activate sevaral levels of venvs.

pipx probably should be considered in most applications instead, but the challange is basically running isolated processes inside an account that by default has an activated venv upon login (breaking this breaks other things).

== coding-scraps == 
From tutorial miscellanea across the web.
